## ðŸ“¥ How to use

- Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/gabriaraujo/proffy.git`

To run the application just open the directories and execute the commands below:
- Install dependencies: `yarn install`
- Run application: `yarn start`

Note that the [Web](https://github.com/gabriaraujo/proffy/tree/master/web) folder contains the entire application developed for the browser. The 
[Mobile](https://github.com/gabriaraujo/proffy/tree/master/mobile) folder contains the project for mobile devices and to run it on the smartphone 
just scan the QR Code generated after executing the commands. The [Server](https://github.com/gabriaraujo/proffy/tree/master/server) folder contains
the project backend, which must always be running for both applications to work as expected.
